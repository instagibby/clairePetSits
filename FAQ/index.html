      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <p class="question">Do you have any requirements for the animals you watch?</p>
      <p class="answer">As a general rule, I do not care for unfixed (not spayed or neutered) animals. I am aware certain species cannot be, and those are taken on a case-by-case basis. I do not work with breeders as there are far too many animals in shelters and humane
        societies that are in desperate need of loving homes. Brownie Points given to those animals who are microchipped, up to date on shots and vaccinations, and in good graces with their vetrinarian : ) </p>

      <p class="question">Why should I choose in-home care versus boarding my animal?</p>

      <p class="answer">Put simply, it&#39;s the less stressful option. When your pet stays at home while you are away, there is no transition to a boarding facility and everything that goes along with being boarded-being crated, a car ride, staying in an unfamiliar, loud,
        kennel; the potential to catch kennel cough, a URI, or another communal disease...the list goes on. At home, your pet sleeps in their own bed, sits in their favorite window, and completely cuts the possiblity of catching a &#39;shelter environment&#39;
        disease. They get to follow their daily routine, and you get the peace of mind knowing they are cozy at home.</p>

      <p class="question">What does a typical day look like?</p>

      <p class="answer">A typical day will look like what your usual day is. I try to stick as closely as I can to what your pet is used to. This again alleviates stress, as they are going to be on the same time table as they are when you are home. Deviating as little
        as possible from their normal will keep anxiety down and spirits high.</p>

      <p class="question">Can you do medications?</p>

      <p class="answer">Yes, I can medicate your pet should they require it.</p>
